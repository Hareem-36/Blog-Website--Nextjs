        The mosque is located in the Walled City of Lahore along the southern side of Lahore's Shahi Guzargah, or "Royal Road," which was the traditional route traversed by Mughal nobles on their way to royal residences at the Lahore Fort.

        Wazir Khan's mosque was part of a larger complex that included a row of shops traditionally reserved for calligraphers and bookbinders, and the town square in front of the mosque's main entrance. The mosque also rented space to other types of merchants in the mosque's northern and eastern fa√ßades, and ran the nearby Shahi Hammam.[14][15] Revenues from these sources were meant to serve as a waqf, or endowment, for the mosque's maintenance.

        Walls of the prayer hall's interior are also decorated with calligraphy in both Arabic and Persian.[24] Each wall is divided further, and contain unique mosaic designs.[26] The acoustic properties of the dome allow for the imam's sermon to be projected across the mosque's courtyard.The courtyard is flanked on four sides by 32 khanas, or small study cloisters for religious scholars. The mosque's four 107 foot tall minarets are located in each corner of the courtyard.
